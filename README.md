# Walking-Coffee-Table
 Hereâ€™s a concise version under 350 characters:  Arduino Bluetooth code for the Carpentopod walking table. Includes two sketches: one for the joystick controller, which sends X/Y axis data via Bluetooth, and one for the table, which receives the signals and controls the motors. Use this code to wirelessly control the table's movement.
